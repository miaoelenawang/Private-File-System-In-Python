## Private-File-System-In-Python
<b>This is parallel universe of file system. Instead of using os module, here we develop fs module</b>
<p>An fs system will be created within a native file f specified by the file system administrator</p>
<p>In creating the file system, the user must first call fs.init(fsname).The argument is the name of the native file in which we will do our storage. </p>
<p>The system will have a function <b>fs.create(filename,nbytes)</b>;<b>fs.mkdir(dirname)</b>;</p>
